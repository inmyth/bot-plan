## Projects Outlines
### Core
- User Interface
    - UI will only manipulate a json file which is read by the bot during runtime. The bot will be able to run without UI.
- Expansion to other exchanges
    - Huobi, OkEX, Binance
- Support arbitrage
- Profit calculation

### Optimization
- Adaptive strategy
    Machine learning, prediction model. Knowing which direction the market will go can help the bot make bigger profit.
    Eg. Big buy volume, small sell volume -> market moves to sell -> reprice sell orders at wider level

- Mapping crypto flow at big exchanges
    BTC flowing in = altcoins are going to go up
    Altcoins moving in = altcoins going to go down because it means the guy wants to sell it
    Need to observe exchanges' cold wallets and hot wallets.
